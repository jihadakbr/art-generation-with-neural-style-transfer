## Objective

In this lab assignment, we will explore Neural Style Transfer, an algorithm introduced by Gatys et al. (2015). Our goal is to implement the algorithm and generate artistic images with unique styles. By defining the style and content cost functions tailored for Neural Style Transfer, we will preserve the desired artistic style while maintaining the original image's content. Unlike previous algorithms that optimize for parameter values, Neural Style Transfer involves optimizing a cost function to obtain pixel values, offering a fascinating creative approach. Through this process, we will delve into the captivating world of artistic image generation and discover the potential of Neural Style Transfer in producing visually appealing and novel artworks.
